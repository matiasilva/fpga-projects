# FPGA projects

This repo houses a collection of projects on FPGA boards that I've used. These are:

* the iCEBreaker FPGA
* the TangNano 9kandand
* the Xilinx Zynq-7000

Most projects use the open source suite of tools for simulation, synthesis and place-and-route.

## Development

1. Source the OSS CAD suite environment:
```bash
source $CAD_SUITE_DIR/oss-cad-suite/environment
```
## Resources

ASIC/FPGA is a tricky world to get into. Though it's far more accessible nowadays than it used to be, it still manages to hide under the radar for most. Over the years, I've made use of some really helpful resources on this topic and I'm leaving them down below for future me.
