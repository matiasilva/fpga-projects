# FPGA projects

This repo houses a collection of projects on FPGA boards that I've used. These are:

* the iCEBreaker FPGA
* the TangNano 9kandand
* the Xilinx Zynq-7000

Most projects use the open source suite of tools for simulation, synthesis and place-and-route.

## Development

1. Source the OSS CAD suite environment:
```bash
source $CAD_SUITE_DIR/oss-cad-suite/environment
```
